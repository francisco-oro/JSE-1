Tasks

Task 1

Using everything you’ve learned up until this point, write a script that asks a user about the width, height, and length of a box, then calculate and return to the user the volume of this box.

As an example, a box with width = 20, height = 10, and length = 50 will have a volume of 10000 (omitting units, as they are not relevant in this scenario). For now, assume that the values provided by the user are valid numbers, but if you have any ideas on how, you can try to make this script in such a way that it will be resistant to invalid values.

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

interacting with the user (dialog boxes – alert, confirm, prompt)
Scenario
Let's go back to our contact list. After some recent tweaks (i.e. using an array and objects) it is actually starting to look like a list. However, one quite serious problem remained. Changing data in the list, such as adding a new contact, has to be provided for right away in the program code. What if we want to give the user the ability to enter the data of the added contact while the program is running? Modify the program to add, at the end of the list, not the contact, which is given in the code, but the one which the user will give during the program run. Use the prompt method to do this. At the end, display the first and the last contact from the list.
